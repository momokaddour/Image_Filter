Modules in Python

To gain access to the variables and functions from a module, you have to 
import them.

For example, importing math, creates a variable that refers to a
module object. A lot of the time, it's important for the functions 
but also some variables can be used (like math.pi)

Doing 'from math import sqrt, pi' only imports those specific 
functions - note - if the module isn't built into the IDE, then the file must 
be in the same folder. 

doing from math import * brings everything.
